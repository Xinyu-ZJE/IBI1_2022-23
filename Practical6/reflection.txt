Today, I learned how to draw bar charts and pie charts with python!!

1. python package downloaded in the wrong directory will not work.

2. importing the dictionary into the chart can save much time. The one-to-one correspondence between key and value is exactly the same as the one-to-one correspondence between x and y.

3. Although a dictionary can't be sorted directly, I can convert it into a tuple and perform the sorting with the lambda function extracting the value as the key of sorting.
