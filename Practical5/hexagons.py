#definite the loop
#calculate the hexagnoal number from the first to the fifth
#output the value
for i in range (1,6): # i represnts ith hexagonal number
 h=i*(2*i-1) # h represents the hexagonal number
 print ("hexagonal number",i,"is",h)

#the output is
#  hexagonal number 1 is 1
#  hexagonal number 2 is 6
#  hexagonal number 3 is 15
#  hexagonal number 4 is 28
#  hexagonal number 5 is 45
