How have new cases and total deaths developed over time in China?

line 100 to line 126

discussion:
Overall, it fits my expectation. After the initial development in the first two months, the number of infected people became larger and began to rise exponentially in March.
In addition, China had a large population density, so the number of total cases in March 2020 was large.
The death toll has been kept low, both because of the low fatality rate and because of medical control
